# Indra's Screensaver

Simple (and ugly) X screensaver based on the indras pearl algorithm. Most of the code is lifted verbatim from my implementation of the Indra's Pearl algorithm. It simply draws Klein Fractals using random parameters for the Grandma's Recipe. I use it with XScreensaver.

# Compiling
Simply run `make`

# Running
`./ceendra`
